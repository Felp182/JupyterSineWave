# pyACAStudy

Python script that reads the pitch of sound files using pyACA.

This script is my first experience using pyACA as is being used as a learning material.

## How to run it

To run the project and check the pitch of any audio file, just call the script using {py compute_pitch.py "File Path"(this being where the file is located in your machine). }

At the moment there is a test.wav that can be used as an example, and that is needed is right click on the file and copy the path.

### Before Running the script:

- Create your Virtual environment
- Run poetry install to get that latest versions required to run the script.
